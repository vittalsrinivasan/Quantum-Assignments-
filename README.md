# Quantum-Assignments
Assigments done for Quantum Computing course during Aug 2020 - Dec 2020 at PES University, Bangalore.

Assignment 1 Problem Statement:
Show that the arbitrary single-qubit state is represented by the unit vector in spherical coordinate system, when plotted on Bloch sphere. Write a python program to display the Bloch - sphere and represent a state input by the user, in phase

Assignment 2 Problem Statement: 
Let σx, σy and σz be the Pauli spin matrices.
σx :=[0 1 1 0] σy := [0 −i i 0] σz := [1 0 0 −1]

Find
1. R1x(α) := e−iα(σx⊗I2) and R1y(α) := e−iα(σy⊗I2) where
α ∈ R and I2 denotes 2x2 unit matrix.
2. Consider special case R1x(α = π/2) and R1y(α = π/4).
Calculate R1x(α = π/2)R1y(α = π/4). Discuss.
3. Confirm the phase implications of the two functions by
displaying in the Bloch sphere

Assignment 3 Problem Statement: 
Implementation and Report of paper “Quantum Image Scaling Using Nearest Neighbor Interpolation” by Nan Jiang and Luo Wang.
